Given an array of integers > 0 where each represents a point (index,value):
Find the maximum rectangular area that can be kept between any two vertical
 lines from the x-axis to the points in the array.

The original problem represents this as maximum water in arbitrary containers
 defined by the array points, but this is in 2D and the metaphor hurts me.

2 <= array.length <= 30000
0 <= array.value <= 30000
