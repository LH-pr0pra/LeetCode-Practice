Given a string, use only the alphanumeric characters and determine if the
 string is a palindrome.
Ignore all spaces and non-alphanumeric characters. Ignore letter case.
For the purposes here, a string empty of alphanumeric characters counts as a
 palindrome; i.e., "" is a palindrome.

The input string will only have printable ASCII characters.
