Begin with a line of stone piles (integer array length n), plus variable M = 1
Alice and Bob (Alice first) take turns seizing piles of stones.
They choose to take all stones in the first X piles of the line, where
    1 <= X <= 2M
The game continues until all stones have been taken.
Assuming optimal play, return Alice's maximum score.

Definitely incomplete at this point.
