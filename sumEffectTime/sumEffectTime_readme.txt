Given an array of effect apply times and the duration per-apply, calculate
 the total amount of time the effect exists for. Overlap does not stack.

Assume the inputs are an integer array and an integer, with the length of
 of the array being less than 10^4, all items being non-negative,
 and no value exceeds 10^7.
 You are not under the assumption that the array isn't empty.

The LeetCode problem uses MOBA game League of Legends as an analogy for this
problem, which is why the method name is "findPoisonedDuration".
