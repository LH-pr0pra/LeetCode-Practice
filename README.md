# LeetCode-Practice
leetcode.com practice problem solutions

leetcode.com is a place to learn algorithms and code implementation in a variety of languages.
This repository contains a description of the problem in a file, and a separate code file with the solution implemented.
Different problems may be completed in different languages.

Additional Notes below:

Java: the java files in this repository are named incorrectly for testing or runtime; this is because the class within them was positioned for LeetCode's testcase system.
If you want to take individual classes from those files, you will have to build a testcase method and main yourself.
If you want to copy the entire file and add a main, you will have to rename the overarching class to match your filename.
