Given an array of non-negative integers where each represents a point at (index, array-value):
Find the maximum rectangular area (that can be kept between any two vertical lines from the x-axis to the points in the array.

The original problem represents this as maximum water in arbitrary containers defined by the array points, but this is in 2D and the metaphor hurts me.

2 <= array.length <= 30000
0 <= array.value <= 30000
