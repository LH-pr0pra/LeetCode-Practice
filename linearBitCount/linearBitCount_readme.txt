Given a non-negative integer, calculate the Hamming weight for every integer,
 0 to-and-including the given.
Return the results as an array (ordered with index = integer iteration).

For improvements:
Can you do it in O(n) {single pass through}?
Space complexity O(n) {only return values}
Don't use built-in functions to extract the Hamming weight.
