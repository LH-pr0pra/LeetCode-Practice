Given a set of non-overlapping intervals, insert a new interval.
Assume the input set of intervals was pre-sorted based upon their first index.

0 <= intervals.length <= 10000
intervals[i].length = 2
0 <= intervals[i][0] <= intervals[i][1] <= 100000
intervals is sorted by [i][0] in ascending order
newInterval.length = 2
0 <= newInterval[0] <= newInterval[1] <= 100000
