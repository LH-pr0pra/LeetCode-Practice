Given a non-negative integer, calculate the Hamming weight for every integer 0 to-and-including the given.
Return the results as an array (ordered as expected: indexes following the integer iterations).

For improvements:
Can you do it in O(n) {single pass through}?
Space complexity O(n) {only return values}
Don't use built-in functions of the language used to extract the Hamming weight.
